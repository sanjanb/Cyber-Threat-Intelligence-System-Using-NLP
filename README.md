# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-System-Using-NLP
AI-Based Predictive Cyber Threat  Intelligence System Using Natural Language  Processing (NLP)

## üìö **Literature Review**

A literature review presents an overview of existing work in the field. Here‚Äôs how to frame it:

### 1. **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**

* CTI refers to the collection and analysis of information about current and potential cyber threats.
* According to [MITRE ATT\&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/), understanding attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) is key to threat prediction.

### 2. **Use of NLP in CTI**

* Researchers like Mittal et al. (2020) and Sabottke et al. (2015) have explored NLP to extract threat indicators from unstructured data (e.g., blogs, forums, threat reports).
* NLP models like BERT, spaCy, and GPT are used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IPs, domains, malware names.

### 3. **Predictive Models in Cybersecurity**

* Machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, LSTM) and deep learning architectures (Transformers, RNNs) are used to predict attacks based on patterns and threat data.
* Predictive threat models trained on historical CTI datasets (e.g., APT reports) can anticipate future threat vectors.

### 4. **Challenges**

* The major challenges include data quality, multilingual sources, domain-specific jargon, and evolving threat landscapes.
* Real-time processing and false positives remain critical limitations.

## üéØ **Objectives**

1. **To design and implement an NLP-driven system for extracting actionable intelligence from unstructured threat data sources.**
2. **To identify and classify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from online forums, blogs, and reports.**
3. **To build a predictive model that forecasts future cyber threats based on historical data.**
4. **To automate threat trend analysis for aiding proactive cybersecurity measures.**
5. **To evaluate the system using real-world CTI datasets for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.**

## üß™ **Methodology**

Here‚Äôs a high-level methodology you can adapt and elaborate on based on your tools and datasets:

### Step 1: **Data Collection**

* Sources: Blogs (e.g., KrebsOnSecurity), Twitter (threat actors), dark web forums, open CTI datasets (like MISP, Hail-a-TAXII, AlienVault OTX).
* Format: JSON, HTML, text documents.

### Step 2: **Preprocessing**

* Clean text: remove stopwords, normalize case, tokenize.
* Language detection and translation if sources are multilingual.
* Annotate and label threat entities (IP, hash, CVE, malware names).

### Step 3: **NLP Pipeline**

* Use **spaCy / NLTK / BERT** for:

  * Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  * Relationship extraction (e.g., malware ‚Üî exploit)
* Perform **topic modeling** (LDA) to find emerging trends.

### Step 4: **Threat Prediction Model**

* Train ML models (Random Forest, LSTM, or Transformer-based models) on structured CTI data.
* Input features: IoC frequency, relation networks, threat actor behavior.
* Output: Probability of future threat types or affected sectors.

### Step 5: **Visualization & Dashboard**

* Use tools like **Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit** to display:

  * Real-time threat maps
  * Entity relations (graph-based)
  * Predictive threat alerts

### Step 6: **Evaluation**

* Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
* Compare different ML/NLP model performances.
